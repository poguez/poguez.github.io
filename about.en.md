My name is Noé Domínguez Porras, I like to do software engineering and computer science.
I like to do things and learn new ones, I believe that learning is something you do for yourself and it is very personal.
I also believe in methods to deschool our society to take advantage of people's intelligence.   
I have been involved in some projects that I believe in, I am a person very driven by what I like.
I have been involved in social and open data projects such as [Datamx.io](http://datamx.io) at [Codeando México](http://www.codeandomexico.org),
where we won the [National Innovation Award in transparency]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/ceremonia-premio-transparencia).

I also worked with friends at [Boletia.com](http://boletia.com), before it was cool. 
Making utilities for the use and publication of open data at [datos.gob.mx](http://datos.gob.mx), [datos.labcd.mx](http://datos.labcd.mx).
There I did some projects for CKAN, data validation, scraping, visualization.
Regarding Crowdsourcing, 

I have done some experiments like [temporadadechiles.com](http://temporadadechiles.com) to collect experiences of Chiles en Nogada on a mobile-first site.
During the earthquake of September 19 with [codersmexico.com](http://codersmexico.com) we launched
[#RevisaMiGrieta](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RevisaMiGrieta&src=typd) and we made a [bot](https://github.com/codersmexico/revisa-mi-grieta-bot).

You can find a small story of Revisa Mi grieta in Fortune Mexico October 2017 edition, and in the
[Revista dels Estudis de Ciències de la Informació i de la Comunicació de Barcelona](http://comein.uoc.edu/divulgacio/comein/ca/numero71/articles/Terratremol-Mexic-social-media.html).
I also wrote a [paper](https://kixlab.org/courses/cs492-fall-2016/projects/minutu/paper/paper.pdf) short about
learning with annotations in presentations and code repositories using emojis.

I am currently a candidate for a master's degree in Computer Science focused on Service Computing and Internet of Things.
You can find me at the [Web Engineering](http://webeng.kaist.ac.kr) Laboratory of the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.
My topics of interest at this stage are the mashup of internet of things services and human-computer interaction.
The mix of experiences I have chosen have formed some opinions about research and development, entrepreneurship,
software development, technology transfer, citizen engagement, Open Data, open knowledge and culture, as well as business.
In the aspect of computer science and software engineering I have learned about Full-Stack web development,
augmented reality, ubiquitous systems, distributed systems and data analysis/visualization.

You can see my Github account to find more projects [github.com/poguez](http://gihub.com/poguez)
And you can see some of my presentations published on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/poguez).
I am always open to hearing new ideas and projects, send me a [tweet](http://twitter.com/noe_dgz) and we talk. 

Noé.

of all profiles and languages.
- [Grupo de Usuarios Scala México](http://scala.org.mx) a community of Scala programmers that communicates through Coders México.

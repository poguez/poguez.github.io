My name is Noé Domínguez, I currently work in software development and integration in Mexico.
The purpose of this blog is to share some of the experiences I've accumulated over the past years while developing my profession and also some of the challenges I've faced.

Currently, I work at [Codeando México](http://www.codeandomexico.org), a non-profit association that combines open data, open innovation, and technology to transform institutions.
In Puebla, I also work with the programmer community of the [Hackers and Founders Puebla](http://www.hfpuebla.org) chapter and [Scala México](http://www.scala.org.mx).
Previously, I have also worked as an independent web developer, I enjoy entrepreneurship and have worked at startups like Boletia Inc. I also collaborated for the Web Development lab at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology under Ph.D. In-Young Ko, in the optical networks lab at the National Institute of Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics under Ph.D. Ignacio Zaldívar, and as a VoIP Networks Engineer at Arisanet.

All this mix of different experiences has shaped some opinions about entrepreneurship, software development, technological development, technology transfer, civic innovation, Open Data, Open Knowledge, and a bit of business. In computer science, I've learned about full-stack web development, ubiquitous systems, distributed systems, and data analysis/visualization.

Every day I strive to be a better person and I hope none of the viewpoints I express make you uncomfortable, they are not definitive and are perfectible. I'm always open to hearing new ideas and projects, you can reach me at: [noe@hackersandfounders.com](mailto:noe@hackersandfounders.com)

Welcome to my blog, I hope we can improve our environment and opportunities together.

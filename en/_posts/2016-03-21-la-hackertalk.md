A couple of months ago I met a group of hackers, now friends, who had an Internet video blog that I really like for its format and content: [Hackertalk](http://www.hackertalk.co).
[Martín](https://twitter.com/mvrtxn), [Abraham](https://twitter.com/abraham_gnz), [Fran](https://twitter.com/FranPR9), [Diego](https://twitter.com/Diegeekster), [Nacho](https://twitter.com/allnacho) and several more friends, throughout several episodes interview some hackers and leaders of initiatives where they talk about entrepreneurship in technology and software, with all the difficulties that implies.

It's not an easy task to build a technology-based company, especially when you have everything ahead of you to do and difficulties to face. One of the biggest challenges that technology-based companies in Mexico face is the time it takes for Research and Development (R&D) to impact society in products that improve lives. UNESCO has talked about this problem and marks it as one of the key components for developing countries to offer high-tech and complex knowledge services and products.

One of the lessons I've learned as a developer in technology-based startups, specifically software, is that we lack better ways to learn core skills, and one of the causes I've always added is to raise the level of technical discussion around the task of developing software.

Talking a bit more about programming solutions, one of my favorites is the use of frameworks and open source libraries to raise your level of knowledge in Software Engineering and Development. It's good to start there because you can learn that there are solutions with specific design foundations defined before you start coding; those details make a big difference when writing software and are part of its philosophy. All languages and frameworks have a philosophy or way of thinking behind them.

I invite you to watch the video and leave a couple of comments to enrich the discussion and share what has worked best for you in your experience:

In this episode we were at [La Madriguera](http://www.la-madriguera.mx) in San Pedro Cholula, which kindly hosts Software meetups in Puebla. And they also give you your first day to work with a cup of coffee.

Noé.

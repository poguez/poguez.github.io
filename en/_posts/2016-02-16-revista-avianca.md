I thought of checking what comes up when I type my name in Google and I found my name in a magazine: *Avianca en Revista*. A magazine distributed on flights of the airline between several South American countries such as: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Mexico, and the United States. How many people must have read it? It excites me.

In 2013 we organized our first civic hackathon, back then we called them *open data hackathons*. And apparently, because of some indexed note, an Argentine journalist, Gabriela Origlia, contacted me, whom I thank for finding us to talk about the topic that then foresaw some practical and dynamic applications that were still being explored. I invite you to read the article to learn a bit more about what a hackathon is, as the article is in the business trends section, written in accessible language for those not so familiar with computing and technology jargon.

If you want to download it, you can do so [here in PDF](http://www.aviancaenrevista.com/ediciones/flips/Avianca_en_Revista_Ed_18/pubData/source/AVIANCA%2018.pdf) and see page 253.

I'm excited because it's the first time I've been cited in a publication with an ISBN.

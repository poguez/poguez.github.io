# Seizing Opportunities

This blog post I write today is to give thanks. As of July, I left two organizations I had collaborated with full-time for the past two years: [Cívica Digital](http://civica.digital) and [Codeando México](http://codeandomexico.org). Along the way, I met many people through collaboration and I am very grateful. Don't worry, I will stay in touch and help where I can.

Soon—in September—I will begin a master's degree in [Computer Science](http://cs.kaist.ac.kr) at the [Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](http://www.kaist.edu). A new project I had postponed for some time and that excites me a lot. I'm excited because I go with a scholarship from the government of the Republic of Korea that will allow me to study without financial worries.

I had been postponing this moment since I finished my bachelor's degree in 2012. And I am grateful that during this time I have met great people, with whom I have collaborated and above all learned a lot along the way. One of the opportunities I am very happy to have taken advantage of is: proposing solutions to the social concerns we Mexicans have. It's a concern that doesn't go away—what holds us back in social progress? Where does software help us? Is technology what we needed to change as a society? There are many things we can improve, and each needs its own proposal. There is a widespread desire to be a better Mexican society, and I am very happy because there are people working to make it happen. The key so far is to be proactive and have the patience to explain new ways of doing things with efficiency, effectiveness, and inclusion.

However, I will not stop these types of collaborations; I am taking a bit of inspiration for what comes next. I want to be a better element for our society that can offer better solutions in the field of technology. Little by little, I will find how to propose in the academic field since it is new to me. While I learn, let's stay in touch—there are many things to do.

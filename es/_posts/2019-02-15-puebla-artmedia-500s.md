In 2013, Puebla flirted with an idea in innovation and design: applying to the UNESCO Creative Cities Network. For several years, together with the municipal government of Puebla, civil society, academia, and industry, we worked on creating a Roadmap. Several projects were defined that could successfully position Puebla within a select group of cities seeking to foster creative potential.

However, Puebla is a capital that is still defining how to use technology to its advantage. In working groups, according to the industry, it has been proposed that technology and design be used to boost the automotive, textile, and materials industries. However, today technology has shown us that it can be present in any industry and can also change our daily lives.

### Who makes Art Media and how do we use it
One of the academic development hubs I admire most is the MIT Media Lab. It is a place where obtaining an Arts degree requires the use of engineering to develop new academic topics. Although it may seem that interdisciplinary projects happen there, Joichi Ito—the director—defines it more as a place where antidisciplinary projects occur. Students and professors not only collaborate across disciplines, but they explore the space between them and beyond. Currently, the lab is defined as a place where projects happen at the intersection of technology, media, science, art, and design; where the world of computing is not just about computers, but about adapting them to our lives, since they are everywhere. Today, through them, we deliver and receive messages; they are a means of communication.

### Technology as a coordinator of new citizen organization

Social networks and the internet have proven to be useful technological platforms for creating new forms of citizen organization. They have democratized information and have positioned themselves as a new means of organization. At the same time, we witness some challenges and phenomena that can enable the scaling of citizen cooperation. They have taught us new ways of organization and governance. A good example of organization through technology is how we responded to the earthquake of September 19, 2017. Mexico organized itself through its citizens in an exemplary way. An interdisciplinary collaboration group among computer scientists, technologists, architects, engineers, data analysts, journalists, and citizens helped recovery and response to earthquake damage happen in a matter of minutes.

With technology, groups and tools emerged focused on resource distribution, fact-checking, work organization, risk assessment, among other solutions. Exemplarily, we used it to distribute resources in a new way, which exceeded the capacity of our Government. Regarding governance, citizens and Government have created new channels of communication and accountability. The availability and right to public information have made possible a new dynamic for decision-making and communication between both.

### Technology can be transformative, but our cities move in the opposite direction
We could say that we take advantage of technology by connecting an isolated person with others and with resources and information. Technology can be binding and promote autonomy. An example of how it can help connect is the dating app Tinder, as MIT Technology Review reported that it has linked disconnected people and increased interracial marriages<sup>1</sup>. At the same time, we have a technological response to create a decentralized financial system through blockchain and Bitcoin technology<sup>2</sup>. Electronic currency has enabled the creation of a decentralized market for goods and services that also allows transparency in transactions. All Bitcoin users are subject to autonomy and transparency by default.

However, when we move to the analysis of life in our metropolis, we find that our city moves in another dynamic, contrary to what transformative technology promotes. For example, we find that the city segregates its inhabitants through housing developments where elite suburbs and others of social interest have been created. Thus, bubbles with different and foreign realities have been generated, which limit political activity and marginalize. We can also say that the great distances between work centers and housing centers prevent citizens from having autonomy in the use of their time, as they must use it to travel from home to work, which prevents them from using it for their own development and that of their community.

### Citizen technology for democracy

A desirable goal in which we can employ technology by 2031 is to extend the citizen's potential in transforming their environment. We can use informational tools to extend their understanding and make more informed decisions and to create a new sense in decision-making about their life and community. The use of public and open data extends understanding of what happens, about budget exercise, and helps with reflection and collective decision-making. In the future, the use of technological platforms will enable new online voting for a more participatory, liquid, and effective democracy: participatory because citizens can be consulted more frequently about issues that matter to them; liquid because new mechanisms of democracy with vote delegation will be created.

Thus, in a liquid democracy, citizens, depending on the votes and the election, can delegate their vote to someone they trust. If a citizen trusts someone to vote for them in park referendums, they can do so, another for water infrastructure, and so on. Through electronic platforms, the best features of representative and direct democracy can be combined.

### Art and its purpose in technology

Technology and art have created a very dynamic combination through new formats that go beyond classical arts. Nevertheless, art itself continues to shake and sensitize people; it creates diverse activations and new spaces. Technology can serve to declare change or create awareness in people. In this way, art with a message, through technology, can provide autonomy and not dependence on a control tool.

Sometimes we glimpse that technology is making us prisoners of a predefined life format, that watches and follows every one of our movements. It is true that this happens, but at the same time it can be a vehicle to deliver impactful messages for social transformation. It is increasingly important to delimit the space of what happens in the digital plane and in our daily lives. Both realities can enable collective consciousness and cooperation. However, it is pertinent that this medium remains neutral, free, and open. It is our responsibility to ensure the privacy of our lives and freedom of expression.

By 2031, other technologies such as 3D printing, virtual reality, and augmented reality will serve as means to make heritage sites in our city more accessible. We will be able to generate replicas of spaces and characters that transport us to other eras; create characters and avatars that intervene in cyber-physical spaces, where reality and virtual space converge in different ways. This will be through virtual visitors, new sensory experiences, and even sensors connected to our brain.

David Eagleman, professor of neuroscience at Stanford University, has studied the phenomenon of sensory substitution. He states that we can have a sensory model similar to what Mr. Potato Head experiences in Toy Story. In this way, we can connect and disconnect senses to our brain, changing their place, and they should work the same way, since the brain can interpret them from any position. Our senses are limited to a small sensory spectrum to which our brain is adapted. Similarly, it would adapt to using other senses if we increased or improved their capabilities. They can even be more than local senses; they can be senses augmented by sensors outside our body. Thus, if we connected the state of the weather to our body, we could develop a conscious sense of the weather, or be sensitive, for example, to the stock market.

The horizon, towards the 500th anniversary of our metropolis, seems distant, but in reality, the technology that is here today will have an impact in a decade. This will happen as we set ourselves the task of developing projects that improve our metropolis. Therefore, we should work to find our own solutions and use our own philosophy for creating tools, in order to be responsible and create the technology we need, and use art and design as vehicles for development in our own reality. Let us use our imagination as the middle ground to materialize our reality through rationality. Two thousand thirty-one, we will be there soon.
